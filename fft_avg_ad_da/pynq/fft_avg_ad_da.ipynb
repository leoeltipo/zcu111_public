    "### FFT Average Project\n",
    "This project uses two ADC input running at 3.072 GHz as inputs to a 16 channels polyphase filter bank followed by 16 FFTs, 32768 points each. The speed of ADCs could be further increased to the maximum of this FPGA, which is 4 GSPS. Together, both ADCs allow to cover up to 4 GHz of analog bandwidth.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input ADCs and mapping\n",
    "The project was developed using ZCU111 and its companion XM500 extension board. Inputs are taken from ADC 224 CH0 for I, and ADC 224 CH1 for Q. These inputs are coupled by Low-Frequency baluns. The project can be easily recompiled using different ADC channels for I and Q.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Polyphase Filter Bank\n",
    "ADC outputs use a AXI Stream interface to deliver the digital samples. Due to the fast speed of the converters, each AXI stream clock gives 8 parallel samples from the ADC. The polyphase filter bank is architectured as a multi-lane approach to take advantage of these parallelized samples. The PFB is 16 channels, 50 % overlap between the channels. This overlap allows to ensure a flat reponse for the PFB over the entire bandwidth.\n",
    "\n",
    "I/Q samples coming from ADCs are fed into 16 Xilinx FIR IPs, which implement the Polyphase Decomposition of the base filter needed for the PFB. The output of those filters is combined and sorted to be presented to the first FFT, also part of the PFB implementation. This FFT is based on a SytemGenerator created 16-point FFT, with 16 parallel inputs. It means each clock cycle the SSR FFT takes 16 inputs and creates 16 output samples. Each output sample represent one sample of a time-domain signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Channel center is given by K\\*fs_adc/16, where K is the channel number. The bandwidth of the recovered channels is fs_adc/8. This reduction by 8 instead of 16 makes it possible to have half the spectrum of the recovered channels to be overlapped with their neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the overlap PFB implementation, odd channels need to be frequency shifted by pi, which corresponds to multiply the time samples by +1 and -1. This is done by the axis pimod block, which comes right after the SSR FFT.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### FFT for spectrum of individual channels\n",
    "The project is not finished yet. In the future, the project will be completed by performing few 100s of averages of the spectrum of the recovered channels. The actual implementation is used as a demonstrator. For this reason, the block axis xfft 16x32768 integrates 16 Xilinx FFT blocks, 32768 points each. This block eats a nice amount of resources of the FPGA, but together with the previous PFB allows to compute the spectrum of the 4 GHz signal without any gaps in the time domain, with a frequency resolution of about 15 kHz.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Channel selection and buffering\n",
    "In this version of the Firmware, a block was added to extract only one channel and decrease the size of the output buffer before transferring data into the Pynq environment. The channel selection block receives all 16 FFT outputs and routes whatever channel is selected into the output. The buffer at the end of the chain is implemented using URAM memory. This allows to let most of the BRAM available for FFT blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output DAC\n",
    "To allow a self contained loop-back project, a DAC output was added that can be used to inject a single tone into the PFB structure. DAC 229 CH3 (LF balun) is configured with a frequency of 6.144 GHz and to avoid using any buffering or extra logic to drive it, a complex constant block was developed. This constant block can be easily configured with a constant complex value. This gives a DC input into the DAC. Then, the DAC is used in Mixer Mode, where x2 interpolation and mixing is performed in the core. By controlling the NCO frequency a single output tone can be created with an extremely cheap piece of logic, due to the fact that the NCO and mixer are integrated into the DAC core.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples to jump start\n",
    "Two simple examples are provided. The first example creates a tone using DAC 229 CH3 as output, and loops-back into the ADC 224 CH0 (only I is provided). ADC 224 CH1 can be 50 Ohm terminated. Depending on the output frequency, the recovered signal will show up on different channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second example is intended to understand the averaging of the spectrum of channels. In this example, an external noise source is recommended to provide wide-band white noise into the system. The example will select one particular channel and perform spectrum averaging by capturing multiple fft outputs and performing the averaging in Python. The averaging process should lower the variance of the noise."
